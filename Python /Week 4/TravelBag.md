1. What is one difference between a list and a tuple? (One key difference is that lists are mutable while tuples are immutable.)
2. When is it better to use a list over a tuple? (In Python, both lists and tuples are ordered collections of items that can contain different types of data.)
3. How do you remove an item from a list? (The simplest way to remove an element from a list by its value is by using the remove()method.)
4. Name at least 2 mutation functions you can use on lists (append(): This method adds a single item to the end of a list. It modifies the list directly (in-place) and doesn't return any value.)
