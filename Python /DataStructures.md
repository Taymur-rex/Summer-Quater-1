1. What are the 4 main built-in data structures in Python? ( List, Set, Tuple, Dicitonary .)
2. What does it mean for data to be mutable? Immutable? ( muutable means is changes after created. ) 
3. What is the difference between a list and a tuple? ( a list is a mutable data structures.) 
4. Pick one of the mutable data structures. How do you add an item to that data structure? ( A list is a mutable data structure, and you can add items to it using the append() or insert() methods.)
5. How do you access an item in a list or tuple? (Python uses zero-based indexing, meaning the first item has an index of 0, the second item has an index of 1, and so on.)
6. What characters are used to create a list, tuple, dictionary &, tuple respectively   (List: Square brackets [ ] enclose elements, which are separated by commas. Example: my_list = [1, 2, 3]
Tuple: Parentheses ( ) enclose elements, also separated by commas. Example: my_tuple = (1, 2, 3) 
Dictionary: Curly braces { } contain key-value pairs, separated by commas. The key and value are separated by a colon :. Example: my_dictionary = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}. )
